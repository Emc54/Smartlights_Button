# Smartlights_Button

This is a small project that uses a NodeMCU ESP8226 microcontroller to connect to IFTTT Webhooks and flip between two scenes on my Smart Life devices.

The trigger is a physical button, and the wiring was soldered into a veroboard, tying pin D2 to ground, and triggering it with 3V3 when the button is pressed.

Programmed on the Arduino IDE, using the boards manager to install the programmer and libraries needed to compile the sketch.
